The history of football dates back to ancient civilizations, where early forms of the game were played in various cultures. The modern version of football, also known as soccer, originated in England during the 19th century. The establishment of standardized rules by the Football Association in 1863 marked the beginning of organized football. The sport rapidly gained popularity, leading to the formation of clubs and international competitions. The FIFA World Cup, first held in 1930, is now the most-watched sporting event globally. Football's universal appeal lies in its simplicity and ability to bring people from diverse backgrounds together, fostering a sense of unity and passion for the game.
