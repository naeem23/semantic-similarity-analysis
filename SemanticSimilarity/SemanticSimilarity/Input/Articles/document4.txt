Mental health is an integral part of overall well-being, yet it is often overlooked or stigmatized. Conditions like anxiety, depression, and stress can have a significant impact on a person's quality of life, affecting their relationships, work, and physical health. Fortunately, awareness of mental health issues is growing, and more people are seeking help. Therapists and counselors are using evidence-based techniques, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and mindfulness, to support their patients. Additionally, digital tools like mental health apps and online therapy platforms are making it easier for individuals to access care. By prioritizing mental health, we can create a healthier and more compassionate society.
