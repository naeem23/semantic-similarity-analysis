On March 4, 2025, the sky over Jafarganj, near the banks of the Jamuna River, witnessed a remarkable feat—one that defied the expectations of an entire village. Amidst the cheers of an awestruck crowd, Julhas Molla, a 28-year-old electronic mechanic from Shaitgar Teota village in Shibalaya upazila, successfully flew an ultralight aircraft that he built with his own hands.

This was no ordinary flight. The aircraft, weighing over 100 kilograms, was entirely handcrafted by Julhas, using a mix of aluminium, stainless steel, and iron. Fitted with a digital speedometer and powered by a modest 7-horsepower water pump engine, the aircraft climbed to an altitude of 50 feet before Julhas brought it safely back to the ground. It was a moment of triumph—not just for him, but for everyone who had doubted that such an achievement was possible in a small Bangladeshi village.

From dream to reality
Julhas's journey to the sky was not an easy one. He had no formal engineering degree, nor did he have access to sophisticated aeronautical resources. What he did have, however, was an unshakable determination and a deep-rooted passion for aviation.

His fascination with flight began four years ago when he started experimenting with radio-controlled (RC) aircraft. Inspired by YouTube videos of aviation enthusiasts, he began designing and assembling small RC planes. But Julhas wasn't satisfied with remote-controlled models—he wanted to build something he could fly himself.

"In 2021, I attempted to make an RC aircraft. The process was challenging, but I kept learning from my failures. By 2023, I gained the confidence that I could build a full-sized ultralight aircraft," Julhas told The Daily Star.

His first attempt at a manned aircraft in 2024 was a modest success—it lifted 10 to 12 feet off the ground. But he quickly realized that his design was not safe enough. Rather than giving up, he dismantled it and started anew, fine-tuning his design for an entire year before his final, successful flight in 2025.
